Right now the Iframe is overflowing its container

I'll help fix the iframe overflow issue by making it responsive. Here's how we can modify the iframe container and the iframe itself:

```typescript:app/page.tsx
// ... existing code ...
              <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
                A short film I produced, wrote, and starred in about learning
                about the LangChain framework.
              </p>
              <div className="relative w-full aspect-video mb-4">
                <iframe
                  className="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full"
                  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yGZ_L1uLa5g?si=xKtyzPUJ1_YuMXjN"
                  title="YouTube video player"
                  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                  referrerPolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
                  allowFullScreen
                ></iframe>
              </div>

              <div className="flex gap-2">
// ... existing code ...
```

The changes include:
1. Removing the `<p>` tag wrapping the iframe
2. Adding a responsive container div with `aspect-video` to maintain 16:9 aspect ratio
3. Making the iframe fill its container using absolute positioning
4. Adding `mb-4` margin to the container for spacing

These changes will make the YouTube video responsive and properly contained within its parent element while maintaining its aspect ratio.
