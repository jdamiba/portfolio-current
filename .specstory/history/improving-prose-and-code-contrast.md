## Improving Prose and Code Contrast (3/11/2025, 1:40:47 PM)

_**User**_

I want there to be a greater contrast between prose and code on my blog page

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the styling to increase contrast between prose and code blocks. I'll update the article's prose class styling to make the text darker and adjust the code block background for better contrast.

```typescript:app/blog/implementing-vector-search-qdrant-nextjs/page.tsx
// ... existing code ...
        <article
          className="prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg max-w-none 
          prose-h1:!text-4xl prose-h1:!sm:text-5xl 
          prose-h2:!text-3xl prose-h2:!sm:text-4xl 
          prose-h3:!text-2xl prose-h3:!sm:text-3xl 
          prose-h2:!mt-12 prose-h3:!mt-8 
          prose-p:!text-gray-800 dark:prose-p:!text-gray-200 
          prose-li:!text-gray-800 dark:prose-li:!text-gray-200 
          prose-pre:!bg-gray-50 dark:prose-pre:!bg-gray-900 
          prose-pre:!border prose-pre:!border-gray-200 
          dark:prose-pre:!border-gray-700 prose-pre:!rounded-lg
          prose-code:!text-gray-800 dark:prose-code:!text-gray-200
          prose-pre:!shadow-sm"
        >
// ... existing code ...
```

I made these changes:

1. Changed prose text color from gray-600 to gray-800 for better readability in light mode
2. Changed dark mode prose text from gray-300 to gray-200 for better contrast
3. Made code block background lighter (gray-50) in light mode and darker (gray-900) in dark mode
4. Added a subtle shadow to code blocks with `prose-pre:!shadow-sm`
5. Added explicit text color styling for inline code with `prose-code`

These changes will create more contrast between regular text and code blocks while maintaining readability in both light and dark modes.

implement syntax highlighting

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you implement syntax highlighting for the code blocks. We'll use Prism.js for syntax highlighting. Here's how to implement it:

1. First, let's install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install prismjs @types/prismjs
```

2. Create a new component for syntax-highlighted code:

```typescript:app/components/CodeBlock.tsx
'use client';

import { useEffect } from 'react';
import Prism from 'prismjs';
import 'prismjs/themes/prism-tomorrow.css';
// Import additional languages
import 'prismjs/components/prism-typescript';
import 'prismjs/components/prism-bash';
import 'prismjs/components/prism-json';

interface CodeBlockProps {
  code: string;
  language: string;
}

export default function CodeBlock({ code, language }: CodeBlockProps) {
  useEffect(() => {
    Prism.highlightAll();
  }, [code]);

  return (
    <pre className="!p-0">
      <code className={`language-${language}`}>{code}</code>
    </pre>
  );
}
```

3. Update the blog post to use the new component:

```typescript:app/blog/implementing-vector-search-qdrant-nextjs/page.tsx
'use client';

import Link from "next/link";
import CodeBlock from "@/app/components/CodeBlock";

export default function BlogPost() {
  // ... existing imports and start of component ...

  return (
    // ... existing JSX until the first code block ...
    
    {/* Replace the existing pre/code blocks with the new CodeBlock component */}
    <CodeBlock 
      language="bash"
      code={`npx create-next-app@latest image-similarity-search
cd image-similarity-search
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow-models/mobilenet qdrant-js`}
    />

    {/* For the embedding-node.ts code block */}
    <CodeBlock 
      language="typescript"
      code={`// utils/embedding-node.ts
import * as tf from "@tensorflow/tfjs";
// ... rest of the code ...`}
    />

    {/* Continue replacing other code blocks similarly */}
    
    // ... rest of the component ...
  );
}
```

4. Add some custom styles to enhance the code blocks. Create a new CSS file:

```css:app/styles/prism-custom.css
pre[class*="language-"] {
  background: #1a1a1a !important;
  border-radius: 0.5rem !important;
  margin: 2rem 0 !important;
  padding: 1.5rem !important;
  overflow-x: auto !important;
}

code[class*="language-"] {
  font-family: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, "Liberation Mono", "Courier New", monospace !important;
  font-size: 0.875rem !important;
  line-height: 1.7 !important;
}

.token.comment,
.token.prolog,
.token.doctype,
.token.cdata {
  color: #6b7280 !important;
}

.token.function {
  color: #93c5fd !important;
}

.token.keyword {
  color: #f472b6 !important;
}

.token.string {
  color: #86efac !important;
}

.token.number {
  color: #fca5a5 !important;
}
```

5. Import the custom styles in your layout file:

```typescript:app/layout.tsx
import '@/app/styles/prism-custom.css';
// ... rest of your imports ...
```

This implementation will give you:

1. Syntax highlighting for TypeScript, JavaScript, Bash, and JSON
2. A modern, dark theme for code blocks
3. Custom styling for different code elements
4. Proper font sizing and spacing
5. Mobile-responsive code blocks with horizontal scrolling when needed

The code will be highlighted automatically when the component mounts and whenever the code prop changes. The styling is customizable through the CSS file if you want to adjust colors or other properties.

Remember to wrap code blocks in your markdown/content with the appropriate language identifier for proper highlighting:

```typescript:app/blog/implementing-vector-search-qdrant-nextjs/page.tsx
<article
  className="prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg max-w-none 
  prose-h1:!text-4xl prose-h1:!sm:text-5xl 
  prose-h2:!text-3xl prose-h2:!sm:text-4xl 
  prose-h3:!text-2xl prose-h3:!sm:text-3xl 
  prose-h2:!mt-12 prose-h3:!mt-8 
  prose-p:!text-gray-800 dark:prose-p:!text-gray-200 
  prose-li:!text-gray-800 dark:prose-li:!text-gray-200 
  prose-pre:!p-0 
  prose-pre:!bg-transparent dark:prose-pre:!bg-transparent 
  prose-pre:!border-0
  prose-code:!text-gray-800 dark:prose-code:!text-gray-200"
>
```

Note that I've updated the article's className to remove some of the pre/code styling since we're now handling that in our custom CSS file.

let's enhance the text prior to each codeblock with more explanation of how the code works. assume readers are novices in both nextjs and vector search

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you enhance the explanations before each code block to make them more beginner-friendly. Here are the updates:

```typescript:app/blog/implementing-vector-search-qdrant-nextjs/page.tsx
// ... existing code until first code block ...

            <h3>Setting Up The Project</h3>
            <p>
              First, let's create a new Next.js project with TypeScript support,
              and install the necessary dependencies. We'll use the official Next.js
              project creation tool, which sets up all the basic configuration for us.
              The additional packages we're installing are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>@tensorflow/tfjs</code>: The core TensorFlow.js library that allows us to run machine learning models in JavaScript</li>
              <li><code>@tensorflow-models/mobilenet</code>: A pre-trained neural network that can analyze images</li>
              <li><code>qdrant-js</code>: The JavaScript client for interacting with our Qdrant vector database</li>
            </ul>
            <CodeBlock
              language="bash"
              code={`npx create-next-app@latest image-similarity-search
cd image-similarity-search
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow-models/mobilenet qdrant-js`}
            />
            <p>
              Next, we'll create the core functionality that converts images into
              vector embeddings. This is where the magic happens - we'll use the
              MobileNet model to analyze images and generate numerical
              representations (vectors) that capture their visual features.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here's how the code works:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>We first load the MobileNet model (only once) and keep it in memory</li>
              <li>For each image, we:
                <ol>
                  <li>Convert it from base64 format to a buffer</li>
                  <li>Resize it to 224x224 pixels (what MobileNet expects)</li>
                  <li>Convert it to a tensor (a special format for machine learning)</li>
                  <li>Generate predictions and embeddings using MobileNet</li>
                  <li>Clean up the memory to prevent leaks</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <CodeBlock
              language="typescript"
              code={`// utils/embedding-node.ts
// ... existing code ...`}
            />
            <p>
              Now we need to create an API endpoint that will receive images from
              users and store their vector representations in our Qdrant database.
              This endpoint does several important things:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Checks if our Qdrant collection exists, creating it if it doesn't</li>
              <li>Accepts image uploads through a FormData request</li>
              <li>Converts the uploaded image to a format our embedding function can process</li>
              <li>Generates the embedding using our previous function</li>
              <li>Stores the embedding in Qdrant with a unique ID and the filename</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The collection is configured to use "Cosine" distance, which is a
              mathematical way to measure how similar two vectors are - the closer
              to 1, the more similar they are.
            </p>
            <CodeBlock
              language="typescript"
              code={`// app/api/add-to-collection/route.ts
// ... existing code ...`}
            />
            <p>
              Finally, we need an endpoint that can take a new image and find
              similar ones in our database. This endpoint:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Accepts an uploaded image from the user</li>
              <li>Converts it to an embedding using the same process as before</li>
              <li>Searches our Qdrant collection for the most similar vectors</li>
              <li>Returns the similarity score (between 0 and 1) and filename of the best match</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              A similarity score closer to 1 means the images are very similar,
              while a score closer to 0 means they're very different.
            </p>
            <CodeBlock
              language="typescript"
              code={`// app/api/compare-image/route.ts
// ... existing code ...`}
            />
            <p>
              With our backend APIs ready, we can create the user interface. This
              React component includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>A section for uploading multiple "ground truth" images to our collection</li>
              <li>Status indicators to show the progress of processing each image</li>
              <li>A section for uploading a single target image to compare</li>
              <li>A display area for showing the similarity results</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The interface uses React's useState hook to manage the various states
              of our application, and provides real-time feedback as images are
              processed and compared.
            </p>
            <CodeBlock
              language="typescript"
              code={`
// app/page.tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";
// ... rest of the existing code ...`}
            />
```

These explanations break down the technical concepts into more digestible pieces and provide context for what each part of the code is doing. They help readers understand not just the what but also the why of each component in the system.

Would you like me to enhance any particular section further or explain any specific concepts in more detail?

I'll help you fix the unescaped entities in the blog post. We need to replace single quotes (`'`) with `&apos;` and double quotes (`"`) with `&quot;` in the text content.

```typescript:app/blog/implementing-vector-search-qdrant-nextjs/page.tsx
// ... existing code ...
            <p>
              Vector search has revolutionized how we find similar content
              across various domains, from images to text. In this post, I&apos;ll
              walk through implementing an image similarity search application
              using Next.js, TensorFlow.js, and Qdrant - a powerful vector
              database.

              <li>1. Allows users to upload ground-truth images</li>
              <li>
                2. Converts the ground-truth images into vector embeddings using
                TensorFlow.js and MobileNet
              </li>
              <li>3. Stores these embeddings in a Qdrant collection</li>
              <li>4. Allows users to to upload target imges</li>
              <li>
                5. Converts the target images into vector embeddings using

              {/* ... */}
            </ul>

            {/* ... */}

            <p>
              With these pieces in place, we can run <code>npm run dev</code>{" "}

I've shown a few examples of the changes needed. The main changes are:

1. Replace `'` with `&apos;` in regular text content
2. Replace `"` with `&quot;` in regular text content
3. Left code blocks unchanged since they're within template literals
4. Left attribute values unchanged since they're properly quoted

Would you like me to show the complete set of changes, or would you prefer to apply these examples to the rest of the file?

                <strong>Qdrant:</strong> A vector search provider that excels at
                storing and querying high-dimensional vectors, perfect for our
                image embeddings.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Understanding Vector Embeddings </h3>
            <p>
              Vector embeddings are numerical representations of data that
              capture semantic meaning. For images, these embeddings represent
              visual features like shapes, textures, and objects. When we run an
              image through MobileNet, it generates a 1280-dimensional vector
              that represents the image&apos;s features. Similar images will have
              vectors that are close to each other in this high-dimensional
              space.
            </p>

            <h3>Setting Up The Project</h3>
            <p>
              First, let&apos;s create a new Next.js project with TypeScript support,
              and install the necessary dependencies. We&apos;ll use the official
              Next.js project creation tool, which sets up all the basic
              configuration for us. The additional packages we&apos;re installing
              are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <code>@tensorflow/tfjs</code>: The core TensorFlow.js library
                that allows us to run machine learning models in JavaScript
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>@tensorflow-models/mobilenet</code>: A pre-trained neural
                network that can analyze images
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>qdrant-js</code>: The JavaScript client for interacting
                with our Qdrant vector database
              </li>
            </ul>

            {/* ... code blocks remain unchanged ... */}

            <p>
              Next, we&apos;ll create the core functionality that converts images
              into vector embeddings. This is where the magic happens - we&apos;ll
              use the MobileNet model to analyze images and generate numerical
              representations (vectors) that capture their visual features.
            </p>

            <p>Here&apos;s how the code works:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We first load the MobileNet model (only once) and keep it in
                memory
              </li>
              <li>
                For each image, we:
                <ol>
                  <li>Convert it from base64 format to a buffer</li>
                  <li>Resize it to 224x224 pixels (what MobileNet expects)</li>
                  <li>
                    Convert it to a tensor (a special format for machine
                    learning)
                  </li>
                  <li>Generate predictions and embeddings using MobileNet</li>
                  <li>Clean up the memory to prevent leaks</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>

            {/* ... code blocks remain unchanged ... */}

            <p>
              Now we need to create an API endpoint that will receive images
              from users and store their vector representations in our Qdrant
              database. This endpoint does several important things:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Checks if our Qdrant collection exists, creating it if it
                doesn&apos;t
              </li>
              <li>Accepts image uploads through a FormData request</li>
              <li>
                Converts the uploaded image to a format our embedding function
                can process
              </li>
              <li>Generates the embedding using our previous function</li>
              <li>
                Stores the embedding in Qdrant with a unique ID and the filename
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The collection is configured to use &quot;Cosine&quot; distance, which is a
              mathematical way to measure how similar two vectors are - the closer
              to 1, the more similar they are.
            </p>

            {/* ... code blocks remain unchanged ... */}

            <p>
              With these pieces in place, we can run <code>npm run dev</code>{" "}
              and interact with our application.
            </p>
            <p>
              The complete code for this project can be found on my{" "}
              <Link href="https://github.com/jdamiba/qdrant-nextjs-template">
                GitHub
              </Link>
            </p>
          </section>
        </article>

        {/* ... footer remains unchanged ... */}
```

I've replaced:
1. All single quotes (`'`) with `&apos;`
2. All double quotes (`"`) with `&quot;`
3. Left code blocks and JSX attributes unchanged since they're properly quoted
4. Left the template literals in the code examples unchanged

The changes focus on the text content where quotes need to be escaped for React. This should resolve all the ESLint warnings about unescaped entities.

I see that you have several featured projects on your homepage. Let's add images to each project card. First, we'll need to create a directory for the project images and then update the project cards to include them.

1. First, let's create a directory for the project images:

```bash
mkdir -p public/images/projects
```

2. Now, let's update the project cards in the homepage to include images:

```typescript:app/page.tsx
// ... existing imports ...
import Image from "next/image";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    // ... existing code until Featured Projects section ...

3. You'll need to add the following images to your project:
- `/public/images/projects/langchain-video.jpg` - A thumbnail or screenshot from your LangChain video
- `/public/images/projects/photogen.jpg` - A screenshot of the Photogen application
- `/public/images/projects/ives.jpg` - A screenshot of the Ives application
- `/public/images/projects/plasma-torus.jpg` - A screenshot of the plasma torus simulation

The changes I've made:
1. Added the Next.js Image component import
2. Added an image container with aspect-video ratio for consistent sizing
3. Used Next.js Image component with fill property for proper image optimization
4. Added rounded corners to match the card design
5. Used object-cover to ensure images fill the space properly
6. Maintained the existing card layout and hover effects

Would you like me to help you create or optimize the project images as well?
