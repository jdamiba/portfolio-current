            <h2>Understanding the Components</h2>
            <p>
              Before diving into the implementation, let's understand our key
              tools:

            <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
            <p>
              Image similarity search has numerous practical applications across various industries:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>E-commerce:</strong> Helping shoppers find visually similar products, 
                "shop the look" features, and detecting duplicate product listings.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Content Moderation:</strong> Identifying inappropriate images, 
                detecting copyrighted content, and finding duplicate or near-duplicate uploads.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Medical Imaging:</strong> Assisting healthcare professionals in finding 
                similar medical images for reference, diagnosis support, and case studies.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Digital Asset Management:</strong> Organizing large image collections, 
                finding duplicates, and maintaining brand consistency across visual assets.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Security and Surveillance:</strong> Face matching, object detection,

              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Implementation Steps</h2>
// ... existing code ...
```

I've added a new section called "Real-World Applications" that outlines six major use cases for image similarity search. This section is placed strategically before the implementation details to help readers understand the practical value before diving into the technical aspects.

Each use case is accompanied by specific examples to make it more concrete and relatable. This addition helps readers better understand why they
